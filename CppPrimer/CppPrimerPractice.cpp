//E3.29 Drawbacks of arrays compared to vectors:
// Array is less flexible, can't add elements or substract elements;

//It's complicated to define or understand pointers or references of arrays;
//arrays can't be copied or re-assigned;
// When defining a character array from a string, need to leave space for null at the end;
// array runs at compile time while vector at runs time so arrays runs faster than vectors;

//Parameter is a local variable. The scope of a parameter is the same as local variable, which is the

//E6.13 Assuming T is the name of a type, explain the difference between a

//void f(T) is passing arguments by value or the function called by value. The value

//function body will not change the argument value.
//void f(T&) the corresponding argument is passed by reference or the function

//E6.14 Give an example of when a parameter should be a reference type.
//Give an example of when a parameter should not be a reference.

//a parameter should be a reference type:
//Using References to Avoid Copies: It can be inefficient to copy objects of
//large class types or large containers. Moreover, some class types (including
//the IO types) cannot be copied. Functions must use reference parameters to
//operate on objects of a type that cannot be copied.

//Using Reference Parameters to Return Additional Information: A function can
//return only a single value. However, sometimes a function has more than one
//value to return. Reference parameters let us effectively return multiple results.

//a parameter should not be a reference: Changes made to the variable have no effect on the initializer


//E6.15 Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_charโs parameters
//In particular, why is s a reference to const but occurs is a plain reference?
//Why are these parameters references, but the char parameter c is not?
//What would happen if we made s a plain reference? What if we made occurs a
//reference to const?

//string s should be constant because we don't want to change s later, we find character c
// in a constant string. occurs is dynamicly changed in the for loop, when counting
// how many character c is showed up.

//For string &s, it is a reference because string is a large container, we want to use reference
// to get rid of copying large object.

//For occurs, we want to change the initializer in the argument it passed to the
//function. So ++occurs in the function statement means the argument will change
//accordingly. And we want the final value returned by ++occurs

//It's fine make s a plain reference in this case, but its dangerous because
//there's possibility changing s by accident

//if occurs is a const, then it always is the value when it was initialized at first


//E6.16 The following function, although legal, is less useful than it might be.
//Identify and correct the limitation on this function:

//bool is_empty(string& s) { return s.empty(); }
//correction: bool is_empty(const string& s) { return s.empty(); }



//E6.17 Write a function to determine whether a string contains any capital

//E6.18 Write declarations for each of the following functions. When you write

//vector<int> vec(10);

//(a) calc(23.4, 55.1); ilegal, the amount of arguments doesn't match with the parameter numbers;

//E7.15: Add appropriate constructors to your Person class.
//Please see Person.hpp


//E7.16 What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an access
//specifier may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members should
//be defined after a public specifier? What kinds should be private?
//Access specifiers are used to enforce encapsulation: members under public specifier
//are accessible to all parts of the programs and they define the interface to the class.
//Members under private specifier are accessible to the member functions of the class
//but are not accessible to code that uses the class. The private section hide the
//implementation
//A class can have zero or multiple access specifiers, no restriction of how often
//access specifiers appear.

//E7.17 What, if any, are the differences between using class or struct?
//Default access levals of class and struct are different. Class has private
//default access while struct has public acess.

//E7.18 What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?
//encapsulation is to hide the implementations or the private members and make
//those members only accessible to the member functions of the class.
//The users won't be able to access to the implementation, or don't need to know how
//the class works. And users won't be able to accidentally change the values of
//class members.

//E7.19  Indicate which members of your Person class you would declare as public
//and which you would declare as private. Explain your choice.
//I would make those class data members private: name, address and population
//I would make those member functions and constructors public: readname (), readaddress()
//Person() = default;
//Person(const string &n, const string &a, const unsigned int &p) : name(n), address(a), population(p){}
//Person(istream&);

//E7.20 When are friends useful? Discuss the pros and cons of using friends.
//It is useful when a function or class is in the interface of a class but not a class member,
//and the function or class needs to access the class members.
//Pro: Non-class function members can access to class members
//Cons: If the implementation changes, the friends may need to change too.

//E7.21 Update your Sales_data class to hide its implementation. The programs
//youโve written to use Sales_data operations should still continue to work.
// Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they
//still work.
//Please see Sales_data.hpp

//E7.22 Update your Person class to hide its implementation.
//Please check Person.hpp

//E7.23 Write your own version of the Screen class.
//Please see screen.hpp

//E7.24 Give your Screen class three constructors: a default constructor; a
//constructor that takes values for height and width and initializes the contents
//to hold the given number of blanks; and a constructor that takes values for
//height, width, and a character to use as the contents of the screen.
//Please see screen.hpp

//E7.25 Can Screen safely rely on the default versions of copy and assignment?
//If so, why? If not, why not?
//We can, because there are only some cases that we can't rely on synthesizd default constructor:
//(1)objects of built-in or compound type (such as arrays and pointers) that are
//defined inside a block have undefined value when they are default initialized
//(2) For example, if a class has a member that has a class type, and that class
// doesnโt have a default constructor, then the compiler canโt initialize that
//member.
//screen only uses std::string, so it doesn't belong to the two scenerio above.

//E7.26 Define Sales_data::avg_price as an inline function.
//Please see screen.hpp

//E7.27 Add the move, set, and display operations to your version of Screen.
//Test your class by executing the following code:
//Please see screen.hpp
screen myScreen(5, 5, 'X');
myScreen.move(4,0).set('#').display(cout);
cout << "\n";
myScreen.display(cout);
cout << "\n";

//E7.28 What would happen in the previous exercise if the return type of move,
//set, and display was Screen rather than Screen&?
//myScreen.move(4,0).set('#').display(cout);
//Move function will return a temporary copy of *this instead of passing a reference to
//the object to set. So set # will only be added to the temporary copy instead of
//the originial myScreen object. So when myScreen.display was called, it doesn't have
//the expected "#" in the output.


//E7.29 Revise your Screen class so that move, set, and display functions return
// Screen and check your prediction from the previous exercise.
// screen myScreen(5, 5, 'X');
// myScreen.move(4,0).set('#').display(cout);
// cout << "\n";
// myScreen.display(cout);
// cout << "\n";
// XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#XXXX
// XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

//E7.30 It is legal but redundant to refer to members through the this pointer.
//Discuss the pros and cons of explicitly using the this pointer to access members.
//Pros: an explicit "this" can reminds the class user that class members are
//being accessed and changed through a pointer. So if there's additional use of
//the changed return value, the return value has to be a reference

//E7.31 Define a pair of classes X and Y, in which X has a pointer to Y, and Y
//has an object of type X.
//Please see XY.hpp

//E7.32 Define your own versions of Screen and Window_mgr in which clear is a
//member of Window_mgr and a friend of Screen.
//Please check Window_mgr.hpp

//E7.33 What would happen if we gave Screen a size member defined as follows?
//Fix any problems you identify.

//pos Screen::size() const {return height * width;}
//Problem: return type is seen before class name, even when it is inside of the
//class scope, it appears outside of the class scope.So the reuturn type "pos"
//needs to have class name in front of it. Correction:
//Screen::pos Screen::size() const {return height * width;}

//E7.34 What would happen if we put the typedef of pos in the Screen class on
//page 285 as the last line in the class?
//it would throw an error "unknown type name pos" when its using pos as parameter types

//E7.35 Exercise 7.35: Explain the following code, indicating which definition
//of Type or initVal is used for each use of those names. Say how you would fix
//any errors.
//With errors:
// typedef string Type;
// Type initVal();
// class Exercise {
// public:
//     typedef double Type;  //Error:can't re-define typename Type
//     Type setVal(Type);//string Type for both return type and parametr type
//     Type initVal(); //string Type
// private:
//     int val;
// };
// Type //string Type Exercise::setVal(Type parm)//double Type {
//     val = parm + initVal(); //Excercise::initval
//     return val;

//E7.36 The following initializer is in error. Identify and fix the problem.
// struct X {
//     X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }
//     int rem, base;

//     int base, rem;
// };


//E7.37 Using the version of Sales_data from this section, determine which
//constructor is used to initialize each of the following variables and list the
// values of the data members in each object:
// Sales_data first_item(cin);
////Constructor used:Sales_data(istream &is) {read(is, *this);} whatever cin takes
// int main() {
//     Sales_data next;
////Constructor used: Sales_data () = default; all members are in class initialized
//     Sales_data last("9-999-99999-9");
////Constructor used: Sales_data (const string &s) : bookNo(s){};
////bookNo is "9-999-99999-9" while other members are in class initialized
// }

//E7.38 We might want to supply cin as a default argument to the constructor
//that takes an istream&. Write the constructor declaration that uses cin as a
//default argument.
//Sales_data(istream &is = cin) {read(is, *this);}

//E7.39 Would it be legal for both the constructor that takes a string and the
//one that takes an istream& to have default arguments? If not, why not?
//No, it will cause ambigous behaviors

//E7.40 Choose one of the following abstractions (or an abstraction of your own
//choosing). Determine what data are needed in the class. Provide an appropriate
// set of constructors. Explain your decisions.
//(c) Employee
//Emplyment() = default;
//Employee(string n = " "):name(n) { }
//Employee(string n, unsigned int p, string a):name(n),phoneNo(p), address(a){}
//Employee(istream &is) {read(is, *this);}

//E7.41 Rewrite your own version of the Sales_data class to use delegating
//constructors. Add a statement to the body of each of the constructors that
//prints a message whenever it is executed. Write declarations to construct a
//Sales_data object in every way possible. Study the output until you are certain
//you understand the order of execution among delegating constructors.
//Please check my Delegating_SalesData.hpp to check the delegating constructors
//Below is the code for checking the outputs:
Delegating_SalesData item15("kiwi", 5, 10.0);
cout << "next\n";
Delegating_SalesData item13;
cout << "next\n";
Delegating_SalesData item14("kiwi");
cout << "next\n";
Delegating_SalesData item16(cin);
cout << "next\n";
//delegated constructor function body first and then delegating constructor
//function body second

//E7.42 For the class you wrote for exercise 7.40 in ยง 7.5.1 (p. 291), decide
//whether any of the constructors might use delegation. If so, write the delegating
// constructor(s) for your class. If not, look at the list of abstractions and
//choose one that you think would use a delegating constructor. Write the class
//definition for that abstraction.
// Delegating version:
//(c) Employee
//Employee(string n, unsigned int p, string a):name(n),phoneNo(p), address(a){}
//Employee(string n = " "):Employee(n, 0, " ") {}
//Employee():Employee(" ", 0, " ") {}
//Employee(istream &is):Employee(){read(is, *this);}

//E7.43 Assume we have a class named NoDefault that has a constructor that takes
// an int, but has no default constructor. Define a class C that has a member of
// type NoDefault. Define the default constructor for C.
//class NoDefault {
// public:
//  NoDefault (int i) : member1(i){}

// };
//
//class C {
// public:
//  C(NoDefault j) : member2(j){}
//  C() : C(0) {}
// private:
//  NoDefault member2;
// };

//E7.44 Is the following declaration legal? If not, why not?
//vector<NoDefault> vec(10);
//illegal.Because the elements in vec can't be default initialized;

//E7.45 What if we defined the vector in the previous execercise to hold objects
// of type C?
//It will become legal and 10 vec elements will be default initialized into 0
//using the constructor: C() : C(0) {} delegating C(NoDefault j) : member2(j){}


//E7.46 Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why?
//(a) A class must provide at least one constructor.
//False: compiler will generate a synthesizd default constructor
//(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
//True
//(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not
//provide a default constructor.
//False: meaningfulness is not a neccessity for default values for a class.
//(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates one
//that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated type.
//True

//E7.47: Explain whether the Sales_data constructor that takes a string should
//be explicit. What are the benefits of making the constructor explicit? What
//are the drawbacks?

//E7.48: Assuming the Sales_data constructors are not explicit, what operations
//happen during the following definitions
// string null_isbn("9-999-99999-9");
// Sales_data item1(null_isbn);
// Sales_data item2("9-999-99999-9");
//What happens if the Sales_data constructors are explicit?
//When Sales_data constructors are not explicit:
//string literal "9-999-99999-9" will be converted to library string.
//item1 will be initiliazed by the constructor:
//Sales_item(const std::string &book): bookNo(book) { }
//item2 argument "9-999-99999-9" will be converted to a string and will be stored
// in a temperory string object which will be passed to the constructor:
//Sales_item(const std::string &book): bookNo(book) { }
//When Sales_data constructors are explicit:
//For item2, the string literal will be implicitly transformed into library string
//However,Item1 or item2 can't do copy initilization such as:Sales_data item2 = "9-999-99999-9";

//E7.49: For each of the three following declarations of combine, explain what
//happens if we call i.combine(s), where i is a Sales_data and s is a string:
// (a) Sales_data &combine(Sales_data);
//s will be implicitly converted into Sales_data through string constructor
//and saved in temp which will pass to combine
// (b) Sales_data &combine(Sales_data&);
//s will be implicitly converted into Sales_data through string constructor
//and saved in a reference to it which will pass to combine
// (c) Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&) const;
//const function can't modify the object passed to it. So i can't be converted
//into Sales_data so it will give an error

//E7.50: Determine whether any of your Person class constructors should be
//explicit.
//Person(istream&); should be explicit so that we don't use copy initilization

//E7.51: Why do you think vector defines its single-argument constructor as
//explicit, but string does not?
//Explicit  constructor can't allow copy initilization. Imagine an initilization scenario.
//vector<int> vec = 10.(if it's implicit) then the 10 could be the size of the vec or
//it could be the element in the vector.
//For a string: string s("abcd") or string s = "abcd" don't make any confusion.

//E7.52: Using our first version of Sales_data from ยง 2.6.1 (p. 72), explain the
// following initialization. Identify and fix any problems.
//Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 15.99};
//It list initialized a temp Sales_data with bookNo "978-0590353403", units_sold 25
//price 15.99 into revenue and then it is copied into Sales_data item.
//Revenue should be price*units_sold, so the last initializer should be 25*15.99.

//E7.53: Define your own version of Debug.
constexpr Debug io_sub(false, true, false);
io_sub.print_error();

//E7.54: Should the members of Debug that begin with set_ be declared as
//constexpr? If not, why not?
//It shouldn't; In C++11, if its constexpr, it is implicitly const which means that
//the funciton can't change data members inside the class.

//E7.55 Is the Data class from ยง 7.5.5 (p. 298) a literal class? If not, why
//not? If so, explain why it is literal.
//It's not literal class. It is an aggregate class but its data members are not
//literal types.

//E7.56: What is a static class member? What are the advantages of static
// members? How do they differ from ordinary members?
//Static class member is associated with the class not with any object in the class.
//it is part of the class and all the class objects share the same static class member.
//Differences:
//1.it can't have in-class initilization except for cibst of literal type
//or a constexpr of literal type.
//2. It has to be defined outside of the class.
//3. It can be used as a default argument for a member function.
