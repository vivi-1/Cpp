//E12.2 Write your own version of the StrBlob class including the const versions
//of front and back.
//Please cehck StrBlob.h

//E12.3 Does this class need const versions of push_back and pop_back? If so,
//add them. If not, why aren’t they needed?

//E12.4 In our check function we didn’t check whether i was greater than zero.
//Why is it okay to omit that check?

//E12.5 We did not make the constructor that takes an initializer_list explicit
//(§ 7.5.4, p. 296). Discuss the pros and cons of this design choice.
